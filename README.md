# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Age calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 (Tried to use semantic HTML as always)
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I did

I should say this is the first time I write something like a readme, I hope this is ok.

As I said I tried to use semantic HTML as much as I can, if there're something I can do better with any of the tools I used please let me know.

With CSS I had problems with the gray line beside the button, I didn't check any other solution or code so, the best idea I had was importing it as an image, svg in this case, and using it. If there's a better solution to this, again, let me know. On the other hand, I also had problems with the mobile view, I had to change it many times until it looks descent, I think is not bad right now but I'll be checking. Normally I work using mobile-first but I wanted to do it different. The rest was pretty normal, I think I reached a good solution in general, but I understand it can be better, I just need more practice and some tips.

And JavaScript was the easiest part for me, when I figured out how to calculate the age it was just a DOM excersice and I think this is a good solution. Maybe it can be more efficient or written in less lines but it works well and I'm happy with that righ now.

Also I learned some Figma. I can't pay the pro subscription so I don't have acces to the figma file, but I recreated the style by myself and it helped me to understand better how to style, so this is good I guess.

As I said, I'd appreciate any comment and suggetion and thank you beforehand.
